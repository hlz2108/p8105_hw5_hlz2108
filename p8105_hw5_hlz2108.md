## Problem 0

This “problem” focuses on structure of your submission, especially the
use git and GitHub for reproducibility, R Projects to organize your
work, R Markdown to write reproducible reports, relative paths to load
data from local files, and reasonable naming structures for your files.

## Problem 1

Read in the data.

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Let’s look at this a bit

``` r
aggregate_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Can I do a prop test for a single city?

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved), 
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample… two.sided

Try to iterate ……..

``` r
results_df = 
  aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

``` r
city_prop_test = function(df) {
  
  n_unsovled ...
  n_total ... 
  
  prop.test(.....)
  
}
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL") %>% 
  nest(data = resolved)
```

    ## Error: <text>:3:14: unexpected symbol
    ## 2:   
    ## 3:   n_unsovled ...
    ##                 ^

## Problem 2

Importing and tidying data files.

``` r
data_files = 
  tibble(
    path = list.files(path = "./lda_data", full.names = FALSE)
) %>%
  mutate(
    data = map(.x = str_c("./lda_data/", path), ~ read_csv(.x))) %>% 
  unnest(data) %>%
  separate(path, into = c("arm", "subject_id", "csv")) %>%
  select(-csv) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    names_prefix = "week_",
    values_to = "observation"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    arm = recode(arm, "con" = "control", "exp" = "experimental")) 
```

Making the spaghetti\_plot\!

``` r
plot_data = data_files %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = observation, group = subject_id, color = subject_id)) + 
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid( ~ arm) +
  labs(
    title = "Observations over Time by Subject",
    x = "Week",
    y = "Observation"
  )

plot_data
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_hlz2108_files/figure-gfm/spaghetti_plot-1.png" width="90%" />

At week 1, observation values were slightly higher in the experimental
group than the control group. The experimental group had increasing
observation values across the study period from week 1 to week 8. The
experimental group had higher observation values than the control
group.Meanwhile, the control group appeared to be relatively stagnant,
with some participants having decreased values at week 8 as compared to
week 1. Overall, the control group had lower observation values compared
to the experimental group.

## Problem 3

``` r
set.seed(1)

n = 30
mean = 0
sd = 5
x = rnorm(n)

# datasets_5000 = function(n, )
```

First set the following design elements:

Fix n=30 Fix σ=5 Set μ=0. Generate 5000 datasets from the model

x∼Normal\[μ,σ\]

For each dataset, save μ̂ and the p-value arising from a test of H:μ=0
using α=0.05. Hint: to obtain the estimate and p-value, use broom::tidy
to clean the output of t.test.

Repeat the above for μ={1,2,3,4,5,6}, and complete the following:

Make a plot showing the proportion of times the null was rejected (the
power of the test) on the y axis and the true value of μ on the x axis.
Describe the association between effect size and power. Make a plot
showing the average estimate of μ̂ on the y axis and the true value of μ
on the x axis. Make a second plot (or overlay on the first) the average
estimate of μ̂ only in samples for which the null was rejected on the y
axis and the true value of μ on the x axis. Is the sample average of μ̂
across tests for which the null is rejected approximately equal to the
true value of μ? Why or why not?
