## Problem 0

This “problem” focuses on structure of your submission, especially the
use git and GitHub for reproducibility, R Projects to organize your
work, R Markdown to write reproducible reports, relative paths to load
data from local files, and reasonable naming structures for your files.

## Problem 1

Read in the data.

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Let’s look at this a bit

``` r
aggregate_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Can I do a prop test for a single city?

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved), 
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample… two.sided

Try to iterate ……..

``` r
results_df = 
  aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

city_prop_test = function(df) {
  
  n_unsovled ...

  prop.test(.....)
  
}
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL") %>% 
  nest(data = resolved)
```

    ## Error: <text>:3:14: unexpected symbol
    ## 2:   
    ## 3:   n_unsovled ...
    ##                 ^

## Problem 2

Importing and tidying data files.

``` r
data_files = 
  tibble(
    path = list.files(path = "./lda_data", full.names = FALSE)
) %>%
  mutate(
    data = map(.x = str_c("./lda_data/", path), ~ read_csv(.x))) %>% 
  unnest(data) %>%
  separate(path, into = c("arm", "subject_id", "csv")) %>%
  select(-csv) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    names_prefix = "week_",
    values_to = "observation"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    arm = recode(arm, "con" = "control", "exp" = "experimental")) 
```

Making the spaghetti\_plot\!

``` r
plot_data = data_files %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = observation, group = subject_id, color = subject_id)) + 
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid( ~ arm) +
  labs(
    title = "Observations over Time by Subject",
    x = "Week",
    y = "Observation"
  )

At week 1, observation values were slightly higher in the experimental
group than the control group. The experimental group had increasing
observation values across the study period from week 1 to week 8. The
experimental group had higher observation values than the control
group.Meanwhile, the control group appeared to be relatively stagnant,
with some participants having decreased values at week 8 as compared to
week 1. Overall, the control group had lower observation values compared
to the experimental group.

## Problem 3

``` r

t_test = function(samp_size, mu = 0, sigma = 5){
  
  sim_data = 
    tibble(
      x = rnorm(n = samp_size, mean = mu, sd = sigma)
    )
  
  sim_data %>%
  t.test(mu = 0, conf.level = 0.95) %>%
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(estimate, p.value)
}
```

``` r
sim_results =
  rerun(5000, t_test(samp_size = 30)) %>% 
  bind_rows() %>%

Let’s make a plot.

``` r
results_df =
sim_results_2 %>% 
  group_by(mu) %>% 
  mutate(
    result = case_when(
      p.value < 0.05 ~ "reject",
      p.value > 0.05 ~"fail to reject"
      )
    )
    
power_plot = results_df %>% 
  group_by(mu) %>% 
  summarise(
    sum = sum(p.value < 0.05),
    count = n(),
    rej_proportion = sum/count) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = mu, y = rej_proportion)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Association between Effect Size and Power",
    x = "True Mean Value",
    y = "Proportion of Times Null was Rejected (Power)"
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

``` r
power_plot
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_hlz2108_files/figure-gfm/power_plot-1.png" width="90%" />

From the plot, it appears that as effect size increases, power also
increases.

``` r
total_p =
  results_df %>% 
  group_by(mu) %>%
  summarize(
    avg_mu = mean(estimate)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = mu, y = avg_mu)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Total Samples",
    x = "True μ Value",
    y = "Average Estimate of μ"
  ) + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

``` r
total_p
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_hlz2108_files/figure-gfm/total_p-1.png" width="90%" />

``` r
rejects_p =
  results_df %>% 
  group_by(mu) %>%
  filter(result == "reject") %>% 
  summarise(
    avg_mu = mean(estimate)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = mu, y = avg_mu)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Rejected Samples",
    x = "True μ Value",
    y = "Average Estimate of μ"
  ) + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

``` r
rejects_p
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_hlz2108_files/figure-gfm/rejects_p-1.png" width="90%" />

``` r
total_p + rejects_p
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_hlz2108_files/figure-gfm/patchwork_p-1.png" width="90%" />

In the plot with all samples, the true mean is approximately equal to
the average estimate. However, in the plot with only samples for which
the null was rejected, the average estimate only approximates the true
mean when the effect size is between 4 and 6. This indicates that when
effect size is large, the average estimate is a good approximation of
the true value. When effect size is small, between 0-3, we can see that
the average estimate is not a good approximate for the true value. The
plot suggests that when the effect size is small, it is possible that
the average estimate would overestimate the true mean.
